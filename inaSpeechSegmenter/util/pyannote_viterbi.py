    Parameters
    ----------
    emission : array of shape (n_samples, n_states)
        E[t, i] is the emission log-probabilities of sample t at state i.
    transition : array of shape (n_states, n_states)
        T[i, j] is the transition log-probabilities from state i to state j.
    initial : optional, array of shape (n_states, )
        I[i] is the initial log-probabilities of state i.
        Defaults to equal log-probabilities.
    consecutive : optional, int or int array of shape (n_states, )
        C[i] is a the minimum-consecutive-states constraint for state i.
        C[i] = 1 is equivalent to no constraint (default).
    constraint : optional, array of shape (n_samples, n_states)
        K[t, i] = 1 forbids state i at time t.
        K[t, i] = 2 forces state i at time t.
        Use K[t, i] = 0 for no constraint (default).
